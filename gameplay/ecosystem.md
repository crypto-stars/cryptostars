## Find a Rock Star

**Rock Stars** are found to be managed from the Audition Stage using STARS each. The price of this search is fixed. Each **Rock Star** has a Salary that represents the income that they will generate in their tour.

After completing a full tour and being called back on the agency, the **Rock Star** will need to rehearse with the band (the rehearse time will be equal to the time spent in tour).

Each **Rock Star** has a maximum number of tours.

Upon reaching this limit, the **Rock Star** retires and no longer goes on tour.

The only option will be to sell it on the marketplace.
