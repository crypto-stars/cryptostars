# :icon-heart: CryptoStars - Rock

**CryptoStars - Rock** is a game inspired by many series of Play-to-earn games bringing through pixelart, a defiant looking and cured esthetic. Become a rock star agent where you can choose either; from finding potential rock stars to managing them, getting them to practice the songs in a studio for the next tour or buy a transport for the band tour.

**CryptoStars - Rock** is built on top of the Binance Smart Chain that gives players full control of their digital assets to participate in an enjoyable gaming environment. Both **Transports** and **Rock Stars** will be minted in the ERC-721 standard which may be traded on our own NFT marketplace.

Our main objetive is to create a balanced long-term gaming environment for players to enjoy their daily gaming quest while being able to colaborate between others who need a game with a low-end entry cost and with those that choose a high-end entry cost as well.
